\description{
The collection of spectra \code{\link{lamps.mspct}} contains spectra for 
light bulds, luminaires and other ready-to-use lamps from various current
and former suppliers. The character
vectors described here contain the names of the spectra for lamps from each
brand to facilitate their extraction from the collection. One
additional vector, \code{lamp_brands} contains the names of the brands as used
in the names of the spectra in the collection.
}
\note{
Some of the lamps are from resellers' brands, usually obscure ones, and
  others are from well-known brands. Some of the brands have changed 
  ownership through take-overs and merges. When known the vintage is 
  indicated in the comment field of each spectrum. Multiple brands may also
  belong to the same company.
