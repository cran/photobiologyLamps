A vector of character strings.

licor_lamps
}
\description{
Lamp emission spectra measured with a LI-COR LI-1800 
  spectroradiometer. Member spectra containing the wavelengths at a 0.5 nm, 
  1.0 nm, or 2.0 nm interval and tabulated values of spectral irradiance for 
  different lamps. As absolute values are not meaningful because measuring 
  distances are in most cases unknown data have been normalized to one at the
  wavelength of maximum energy irradiance.
}
\details{
\code{licor} is a character vector with indexes to members of 
  \code{\link{lamps.mspct}}
}
\note{
Instrument used: LI-COR LI1800 scanning single monochromator 
  spectroradiometer with a cosine corrected input optics. Recently calibrated
  with a LI-COR calibration lamp. Measurements done by Pedro J. Aphalo 
  between 1992 and 2001.
