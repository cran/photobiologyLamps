\title{Spectra acquired with Bentham spectrometer}
\format{
An object of class \code{character} of length 2.
}
\usage{
bentham_lamps
}
\description{
Spectra measured with a Bentham spectroradiometer. Datasets
contain wavelengths at a 0.5 nm interval and corresponding values for spectral
emittance from different lamps. As absolute values are not meaningful because
measuring distances are in most cases unknown data have been normalized to
one at the wavelength of maximum energy irradiance.
}
\details{
\code{bentham_lamps} is a character vector with indexes to members of 
  \code{\link{lamps.mspct}}
}
\note{
Instrument used: Bentham scanning double monochromator
spectroradiometer with a cosine corrected input optics. Recently calibrated
at STUK (Radiation Safety Authority Finland). Measurements done by Lasse
Ylianttila (STUK, Helsinki, Finland).
