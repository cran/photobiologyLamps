## Introduction

This package, is a data only package, part of a suite, which has package 
'photobiology' at its core. Please visit (https://www.r4photobiology.info/) 
for more details. For more details on plotting spectra, please consult the 
documentation for package 'ggspectra', and for information on the calculation 
of summaries and maths operations between spectra, please, consult the 
documentation for package 'photobiology'.

library(ggspectra)
```

In this brief User Guide we describe how to re-scale the normalized
spectra, and how to access individual spectra or subsets of spectra.

Spectra in the package are contained in three collections: `lamps.mspct`
contains spectral data for various types of lamps emiiting a fixed color of
light; `ledsavers.mspct` contains spectral data for a LED bulb with four color
channels allowing it to output 16 different _colors_ of light;
`qp_uvb313_temp.mspct` contains spectral data for UV lamps under seven different
temperatures. In addition `qp_uvb313_temp.spct` contains the same data in a
single spectral object.

In addtion to the objects containing the data itself, several character vectors 
of names of spectra are provide to facilitate the retrieval of subsets of spectra.

## Accessing individual spectra

The `source_spct` member objects in `lamps.mspct` can be accessed through their
names or through a numeric index. As the numeric indexes are likely to change 
with updates to the package, their use is discouraged. Names as character
strings should be used instead. The names are listed in the documentation
and also available through the "Data Catalogue" vignette. They can also be
listed with method `names()`.

```{r}
names(lamps.mspct)
```

We can use a name as index to extract an individual `source_spct`
object.

```{r}
lamps.mspct$Generic.Inc.bulb.60W
```

Or a character string.

```{r}
lamps.mspct[["Generic.Inc.bulb.60W"]]
```

Be aware that according to R's rules, using single square brackets will return
a `source_mspct` object possibly of length one. This statement is not equivalent
to the one in the chunk immediately above.

```{r}
lamps.mspct["Generic.Inc.bulb.60W"]
```

## Accessing subsets of spectra

We can subset the `source_mspct` object by indexing with vectors of character
strings. The package provides some predefined ones, and users can easily
define their own, either as constants or through computation. Here we use
a vector defined by the package.

```{r}
lamps.mspct[Toshiba_lamps]
```

And below we use a computed one. In this case we extract the member spectra
with names containing the string "toshiba". More generaly one can search for 
matching names within the collection of spectra.

```{r}
lamps.mspct[grep("Toshiba", names(lamps.mspct))]
```

Set algebra operations can be used with the indexing vectors as each vector
describes a single property: color, brand, type, etc.

```{r}
lamps.mspct[intersect(Philips_lamps, red_lamps)]
```

## Rescaling spectral data

The spectra are normalized, and consequently, several summaries expressed in
absolute units are undefined, and trigger errors. Summaries like ratios which
are not affected by normalization are allowed and valid. The data have been
normalized as the measuring conditions used are not all the same, and in many
cases not well characterized (e.g. distance to light source, or exact 
alignment of the spectrometer input optics with respect to the center of the
light beam from sources).

These uncertainties in the measurment conditions are likely to have minimal effect
on the shape of the spectrum when plotted. This allows us to reconstruct the
spectrum at a different distance from the lamp(s) or under a different number of 
lamps as long as we know the irradiance for some known waveband, such as PAR. 

In this section we will rescale the spectral data so that after 
re-scaling a given target value for a summary quantity will be true. As an 
example, we will rescale one spectrum so that it yields an energy irradiance of
100 W m-2 for the range 400 to 700 nm. By default the returned spectrum is not
labelled as being expressed in relative units, as the expectation is that the
operation is done to obtain spectral emission data that could have been measured
at a target condition that we want to simulate or reconstruct.

```{r}
my.spct <- fscale(lamps.mspct$Generic.Inc.bulb.60W,
                  range = c(400, 700),
                  f = e_irrad,
                  target = 100
                  )
e_irrad(my.spct, waveband(c(400,700)))
```

```{r}
is_scaled(my.spct)
```

To do the scaling based on photon irradiance, different approaches are available to change the default. Here as above we specify the function to use through the argument passed to `f` and set a suitable target in mol m-2 s-1. We use 300e-6 to indicate 300 umol m-2 s-1.

```{r}
my.spct <- fscale(lamps.mspct$Generic.Inc.bulb.60W,
                  range = c(400, 700),
                  f = q_irrad,
                  target = 300e-6
                  )
q_irrad(my.spct, waveband(c(400,700)))

```

In the special case when `target == 1`, the default changes, assuming that
in this case the intention is to re-express the spectral data in relative units.

```{r}
my.spct <- fscale(lamps.mspct$Generic.Inc.bulb.60W,
                  range = c(400, 700),
                  f = e_irrad,
                  target = 1
                  )
is_scaled(my.spct)
```

If we want to override the defaults for tagging as scaled, we ccan pass a
suitable argument to parameter `set.scaled` of `fscale()`.

In addition to scaling based of the summary calculated by a function, as shown
above, it is frequent to _normalize_ spectral data. In this case scaling is
done so that spectral irradiance matches a certain value at an specific
wavelength. In most cases, the wavelength used is that of the maximal spectral 
irradiance, and the target value is 1. These are the defaults and in this case
the returned spectra are always labeled as being normalized. We use a blue
fluorescent tube for this example.

```{r}
normalize(lamps.mspct$Philips.FT.TLD.36W.15)
```

Ratios can be calculated directly as they are not affected
by normalization or linear rescaling.

```{r}
q_ratio(my.spct, Red("Smith10"), Far_red("Smith10"))
```

## Plotting the spectra

Using `autoplot()` methods for spectra defined in package 'ggspectra' annotated
plotting are created with automatically genrateda xis labels, annotations and
decorations. The defaults can be easily changed, please see the documentation in
package 'ggspectra'. For most of the data included in the package, as told
above, exact alignment was not ensured and the exact distance not recorded. In
such cases the data included in the package have been normalized to 1 at the
tallest peak of emission, as can be seen in the example below.

```{r}
autoplot(lamps.mspct$Osram.LED.8W.2700K)
```

Data for a four channel, remote controlled, LED bulb is included in object 
`ledsavers.mspct`. 

```{r}
what_measured(ledsavers.mspct$purple)
how_measured(ledsavers.mspct$purple)
```

In this case, data are not normalized, as all spectra in the object have been
measure with the lamp and entrance optics in exactly the same position,
controlling emission with wireless remote controller. In the next example we see
that _purple_ is created as a mix of blue and red light.

```{r}
autoplot(ledsavers.mspct$purple)
```

Using the `ggplot()` method for spectra from package 'ggspectra' plus
_geometries_ and _statistics_ from package 'ggplot2' we gain additional control
on the design.

```{r}
ggplot(ledsavers.mspct$purple) +
  geom_line(linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_classic()
```

We can also plot multiple spectra. In this example we plot the pure emission
from each of the four channels of the bulb.


```{r}
autoplot(ledsavers.mspct[c( "W", "R", "G", "B")],
         annotations = c("+", "title:what")) +
  labs(linetype = "Channel")
```

## Using the data in other contexts

In general it will be easiest to use methods from packages in the
'r4photobiology' suite for plotting and calculation of various summaries.
However, as `source_mspct` is a class derived from `list`, and `source_spct` is
derived from `tibble::tibble` that is a partly compatible reimplementation of
`data.frame` the data can be used very easily with R functions expecting data
frames as input.

```{r}
head(as.data.frame(lamps.mspct$Osram.LED.8W.2700K))
```

Of course `attach` and `with` also work as expected.

```{r}
attach(lamps.mspct)
q_ratio(Osram.LED.8W.2700K, Blue(), Red())
detach(lamps.mspct)
```

```{r}
attach(lamps.mspct)
with(Osram.LED.8W.2700K, max(w.length))
detach(lamps.mspct)
```

```{r}
with(lamps.mspct, q_ratio(Osram.LED.8W.2700K, Blue(), Red()))
```
