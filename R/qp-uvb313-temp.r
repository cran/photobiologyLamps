#' Spectral irradiance of UVB lamps at different temperatures.
#'
#' Dataset of spectral irradiance from a set of two Q-Panel UVB-313 40W
#' fluorescent tubes, measured at different temperatures.
#'
#' Absolute values are comparable among the different temperatures. The lamps
#' and the cosine diffuser were located inside a Conviron growth chamber. The
#' measurements were done with a recently calibrated Macam double-monochromator
#' spectroradiometer located outside the chamber and maintained at constant room
#' temperature of 22 C. After each change in the temperature controller
#' set-point enough time was allowed after the temperature had stabilized inside
#' the chamber, for the output of the lamps to also become stable.
#'
#' @note Instrument used: Macam SR-9010-PC scanning double monochromator
#' spectroradiometer with a cosine corrected input optics. Recently calibrated.
#' The lamps were driven by a high frequency electronic ballast.
