#' Spectral data for Lamps from different suppliers
#' 
#' The collection of spectra \code{\link{lamps.mspct}} contains spectra for 
#' light bulds, luminaires and other ready-to-use lamps from various current
#' and former suppliers. The character
#' vectors described here contain the names of the spectra for lamps from each
#' brand to facilitate their extraction from the collection. One
#' additional vector, \code{lamp_brands} contains the names of the brands as used
#' in the names of the spectra in the collection.
#' 
#' @note Some of the lamps are from resellers' brands, usually obscure ones, and
#'   others are from well-known brands. Some of the brands have changed 
#'   ownership through take-overs and merges. When known the vintage is 
#'   indicated in the comment field of each spectrum. Multiple brands may also
#'   belong to the same company.
