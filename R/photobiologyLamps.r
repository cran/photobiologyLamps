#' @details This package contains emission spectra for different types of lamps
#' including LED lamps sold as fully assembled light bulbs or luminaires but
#' excluding LEDs sold as components requiring separate electronic driver
#' modules or circuits. Lamps have been measured with an assortment of different
#' instruments over more than 25 years in our lab or by collaborators. Some of
#' the lamp types are no longer in production but the data are relevant for the
#' interpretation of old scientific publications. Data for lamps emitting in the
#' UV and VIS regions of the spectrum are represented in these data sets. In
#' addition a set of spectral emission for UVB lamps exposed to different
#' ambient temperatures is include.
#'
#' The package contains two collections of spectra for different lamps all of
#' them measured at air temperatures between 20 C and 25 C and a series of
#' vectors to be used as indexes to extract different subsets of spectra. These
#' spectral data are normalized to spectral energy irradiance equal one at
#' their maximum (strongest emission peak).
#'
#' Temperature response data is included as a separate collection of
#' spectra both as a \code{source_mspct} object and as a \code{source_spct}
#' object.
#' 
#' A third collection of spectra contains data for the 16 different _colors_ of 
#' light emitted by a household four channel LED bulb.
#'
#' @section Warning!:
#' None of the spectral data included in this package are based on supplier's
#' specifications and are only for information. The exact emission spectrum
#' depends to some extent on testing conditions, but more importantly among
#' individual lamps. It is not uncommon for suppliers to revise specifications
#' during the lifetime of a product type without changing the product
#' denomination. There can be also some variation from batch to batch. It is
#' also important to make sure that the type considered exactly matches.
#' Frequently variations of a lamp type, with type denomination differing in
#' a single letter or number, have quite different spectral characteristics. In
#' other words, the data provided here are not a substitute for actual
#' measurements of radiation emission and spectrum of the lamps actually used in
#' a given piece of scientific research. For less demanding situations the data
#' are in most cases reliable enough but perfect agreement with measurements on
#' other lamps of the same exact type should not be expected. This is specially
#' true for those data measured more than a few years ago when compared to lamps
#' being currently sold under the same type denomination.
